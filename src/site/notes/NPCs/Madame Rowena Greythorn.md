##### Background

Little is definitively known about Madame Rowena Greythorn's early years.  Some accounts suggest she was born in a small  village shrouded by mist and rumor, while others claim her origins trace back to the [[1. World Almanac/Regions/Kingdom of Valmere/Valmere Region\|Valmere Region]].

Family names associated with her include **Greythorne**, **Grimwald**, and sometimes simply “the Lady of Ravenswatch.”

##### Career

In her teenage years, Madame Greythorn had become an enigmatic fixture among Valmere's esoteric circles. Rumors foretell her extensive knowledge in the arts,  arcane discussions and clandestine rituals, attended by artists, aristocrats, and exiles alike.

Her estate in the region  became legendary—a place where secrets were traded as readily as fortunes told. Witnesses describe rooms lined with mirrors that never reflected quite what one expected.

##### Abilities and Reputation

Madame Greythorn is best known for her uncanny talents:

- **Divination:** She is famed for reading futures in patterns of smoke or pools of black ink.
- **Psychometry:** Objects handed to her reportedly reveal their histories—sometimes even their destinies.
- **Occult Knowledge:** Her understanding of forbidden texts has led some scholars to call her the “last true Hexenmeister.”

Despite—or because of—these gifts, she remains an ambiguous figure: revered by some as a wise mentor; whispered about by others as a manipulator of fate.

##### Later Years & Present Whereabouts

By accounts, after the dissertion of the Valmere Region Rowena settled down in the region of [[1. World Almanac/Regions/Hireld/Hireld\|Hireld]] in the small town of [[1. World Almanac/Regions/Hireld/Cities and Towns/Wilinawood/Wilinawood\|Wilinawood]]. She later purchased and now operates the [[1. World Almanac/Regions/Hireld/Cities and Towns/Wilinawood/The Silver Lantern Inn\|The Silver Lantern Inn]]. She forever stands by for her new profession, taking permanent refuge in the suite room upstairs.
