##### History

Nestled between the mainland and the Eastern Islands of Eredurn, the region of Hireld has long been a crossroads for travelers and cultures. Earliest records suggest that nomadic tribes settled the area over two millennia ago, drawn by its fertile valleys . Over time, these tribes coalesced into small agrarian communities, laying the foundations for Hireldâ€™s earliest villages.

By the year 450 , Hireld found itself at the intersection of larger kingdoms vying for influence. Its strategic location made it a contested territory, resulting in a patchwork of fortifications and alliances. Despite frequent conflicts, the region prospered as a center for trade. 

As the Fourth Epoch began and the reminants of the Valmere Army struggle to keep control, the land of Hireld has been the last safe haven for their forces. While many in the land also see them as the enemies, Baron Wyrmling respects their cause and continues to keep up the fight during Queen Ariel's absence.
