##### History

The largest known quarry in the modern world. Nestled inside of a mountain that the City was built around, This quarry is mainly used to produce stone, gravel, granite, and other resources from the earth. 

Over centuries, the Asphalt Quarry has shaped not only the landscape but also the identity of the City itself. Early settlers were drawn to the mountain’s rich mineral veins, and as extraction techniques advanced, so did the scale of operations. Entire neighborhoods sprang up around the quarry to house workers and their families, fostering a close-knit community whose rhythms were dictated by the steady hum of machinery and the clang of pickaxes against stone.

Throughout its long history, the quarry has witnessed moments of both triumph and turmoil. Booms in construction sent demand for its resources soaring, leading to periods of rapid expansion. Conversely, environmental concerns and labor disputes have occasionally brought operations to a standstill, forcing innovation and negotiation between city officials and quarry management. The resulting compromises have led to pioneering methods in sustainable mining practices—balancing resource extraction with preservation of the surrounding mountain ecosystem.
