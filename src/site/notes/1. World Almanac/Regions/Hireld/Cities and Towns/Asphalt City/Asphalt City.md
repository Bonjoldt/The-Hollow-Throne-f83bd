##### History

Founded decades ago on a rich deposit of bitumen and stone, Asphalt City quickly outpaced neighboring towns to become a powerhouse of manufacturing and construction. The quarry is the city’s beating heart: day and night, colossal machines grind rock into asphalt, sending convoys of trucks rolling out to pave highways, runways, and city streets far beyond the city limits. From here, roads are born.

The prosperity brought by the quarry has shaped every aspect of life in Asphalt City. Towering smokestacks silhouette against neon-lit skies; factories cluster around the quarry’s edges, processing materials for export or feeding local infrastructure projects. Entire neighborhoods have grown up around the rhythms of shift changes—cafés open early for dawn crews; bars buzz late into the night with off-duty workers.

But The Asphalt City is more than soot and stone. Its people are resilient—toughened by hard labor but fiercely proud of their community. Local festivals celebrate both tradition and progress; murals turn drab concrete into vibrant tributes to laborers and machine operators alike.

Yet, challenges remain: environmental tensions simmer as clouds of dust drift over homes; debates rage over how much longer the quarry can sustain growth without threatening the land itself. Even so, innovation thrives—researchers develop cleaner extraction methods while entrepreneurs imagine new uses for recycled road materials.

In The Asphalt City, industry doesn’t just build roads—it builds lives, connections, and futures. Here, every street begins with a story from deep within the earth—and every resident carries a piece of that legacy forward.

##### Geography

The Asphalt City is defined by its industrial landscape and strategic placement of key sites. In the northwest sits  [[1. World Almanac/Regions/Hireld/Cities and Towns/Asphalt City/The Asphalt Quarry\|The Asphalt Quarry]], dominating the skyline with its constant activity and heavy machinery. The city itself sprawls to the southeast of the quarry, with residential blocks clustered centrally and commercial zones stretching towards the riverbanks in the east. To the south, warehouses and transport depots line the roads, facilitating swift movement of asphalt products throughout the world. Parks and schools are scattered amid neighborhoods, offering respite from the city’s industrious pace.
