##### History

The Silver Lantern Inn has been around since the hamlet of Wilinawood was founded. Previously named the Wilina Inn, during the First Epoch it was used as a safe haven for those fleeing the calamity that separated the region of Eredurn from the rest of the world. It has gone through many different owners and world-ending events, but the spirit of the townsfolk and of the inn itself remained the same.

After the beginning of the Fourth Epoch, the Inn was purchased by Madame Rowena Greythorn and changed to The Silver Lantern Inn. It's unknown why she chose the name, but the town residents and travelers did not seem to care. At the end of it all she made sure to follow suit in the previous owners' footsteps, using it as a hub  for the remaining Valmere forces to safetly travel throughout the region.
