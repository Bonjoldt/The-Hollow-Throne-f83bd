###### History

Nestled deep within the rolling green hills and ancient forests of [[1. World Almanac/Regions/Hireld/Hireld\|Hireld]], the hamlet of Wilinawood quietly endures. A handful of mossy cottages with thatched roofs cluster together along a single cobblestone lane, their gardens brimming with wildflowers and herbs. The scent of pine and peat hangs in the crisp morning air, mingling with woodsmoke curling from weathered chimneys.

Wilinawood was first settled nearly two centuries ago by woodcutters and trappers seeking shelter from fierce northern winds beneath the protective boughs of the Wilina Grove—a legendary stand of leafless trees believed by locals to be blessed by ancient woodland spirits. Over time, families of herbalists, craftsmen, and hunters joined them, drawn by tales of plentiful game and enchanted springs.

Life here moves at its own unhurried pace. The villagers rely on each other for survival—sharing harvests, mending fences together, celebrating festivals under lantern-lit branches. Though small in number (rarely more than eighty souls), Wilinawood’s people are hardy and resourceful.

The hamlet is not without its mysteries. Faint lights sometimes flicker at dusk among the deeper woods; old songs warn children not to stray beyond sight of home after nightfall. Some claim to have glimpsed ethereal figures or heard music drifting from unseen revelers within the ancient grove.

Travelers rarely find Wilinawood unless guided by one who knows its winding paths. Outsiders are met with cautious hospitality—welcome at hearth and table but gently discouraged from asking too many questions about what lies beyond the tree line.

For those who stay long enough to earn trust, Wilinawood reveals itself as a place where tradition and folklore entwine—a haven shaped as much by natural beauty as by secrets whispered on chilly evenings beneath moonlit leaves.

##### Geography

On the north side of the hamlet sits the Stone Heath, a communal game room that many travelers and locals a like spend most of their time gambling. In the center of the settlement stands the Silver Lantern Inn, which  as a tradeless hamlet is where the main source of income supports the abysmal economy. On the southern edge sits a market with few traders who are always willing to negotiate for a coin. To the northeast sits Bracejaw, a place of religious gathering for soldiers. Some say those who pray at the statue before battle are granted a lifetime of fortune.
