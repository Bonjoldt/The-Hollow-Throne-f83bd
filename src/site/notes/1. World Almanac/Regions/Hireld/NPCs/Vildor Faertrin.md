##### Background

Vildor Faertrin hails from a long line of dragonborn stonemasons, his scales mottled slate-gray from generations spent amid dust and grit. Raised in the Asphalt City, Vildor learned to read stone before he could read words, spending his youth hauling rubble and listening to the elders’ tales of fire-breathing ancestors who carved mountains. His imposing stature and even temper quickly earned him respect among the quarry workers, many of whom see him as both mentor and protector.


##### Career 

Now foreman of the region’s largest asphalt quarry, Vildor commands with a blend of discipline and empathy, balancing unforgiving safety rules with genuine concern for his crew’s well-being. He has a knack for spotting hidden faults in rock as easily as he senses discord among his workers.  As foreman he is also in charge of the city itself.

Despite outward success, Vildor wrestles with the expectations of his heritage—torn between honoring ancient dragonborn traditions and embracing the pragmatic demands of modern industry. Yet every evening, as he surveys the sun setting over newly-laid stone, he feels pride in forging something lasting—not through flame or fury, but through steady hands and steadfast heart.

##### Abilities and Reputation

Vildor is known more for his brawn than his brain. Raised in a quarry all of his life all he's ever known is how to punch his way through anything. Among his various strengths:

- **Firebreathing**: Being a Dragonborn, he possesses the unique ability to cast a breathe of fire from his mouth.
- **Physical Strength:** His brute strength is enough to break stone.
- **Natural Charisma**: His personality and aptitude for being a charismatic leader is one of his more well known quirks.

##### Present

In recent years, Vildor's leadership of the quarry had turned sour. With the ongoing conflict sending most of his men off to war and not return, Vildor made the executive decision to invoke slave labor in order to meet the quarry's high quota. While many see this as inhumane, he sees it as a glorious opportunity for those he takes under his wing.
